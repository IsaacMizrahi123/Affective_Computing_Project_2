# Affective_Computing_Project_2
Python script that identifies (classify) pain from images, using Machine Learning. This project uses Tensorflow Keras and sklearn metrics.

To run the script: python Project2.py W H dataDirectory

Where W is the width of an image (integer); H is the height of an image (integer); and dataDirectory is the directory where data is located. This is an absolute directory. Donâ€™t make it relative to the script.

This script use deep learning to classify the images as either pain or no pain.

The Data directory has to follow a hierarchy as follows:
Project2Data
* Testing
  - Pain
  - Image data
  - No_pain
  - Image data
* Training
  - Pain
  - Image data
  - No_pain
  - Image data
* Validation
  - Pain
  - Image data
  - No_pain
  - Image data

The output of the script prints the confusion matrix, classification accuracy, precission, recall, and binary F1 score for the test set.

A PDF file with the results of the project is included.
